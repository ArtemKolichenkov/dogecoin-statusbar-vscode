# Dogecoin statusbar ðŸš€

Realtime dogecoin price in status bar, multiple currencies.

## Features

Adds an item on the status bar where you can see:
- Dogecoin price in selected currency
- Price change over 24 hours
- When price was last updated at [coingecko.com](https://www.coingecko.com/)

Prices are coming via [Coingecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api). Usual update time is ~1 minute, but I noticed it can be up to 5 minutes for the price to change. The extension queries the API every 30 seconds.
